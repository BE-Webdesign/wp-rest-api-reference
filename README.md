# wp-rest-api-reference
A WordPress REST API Reference managing plugin.

## Installing.
Add this plugin to your WordPress install. This plugin requires version 4.7 or higher. [If you need help manually installing a plugin check out this great guide.](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) Activate the plugin and you are done.

## Using.
Once the plugin is active navigate to `mydomain.com/rest-reference`. You will see your REST API reference graphically represented. Currently there is no CSS styling really other than what is loaded by the theme in the `wp_head()` call.
